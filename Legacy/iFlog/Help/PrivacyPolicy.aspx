            <h3>What information we collect<a name="1" id="1"></a></h3>
            <p>
                In general, the personal information we collect about you includes (but is not limited
                        to) your name, contact details (including phone numbers and addresses) and possibly

            </p>
            <p>
                We also collect information about you that is not personal information. For example,
                        we may collect data relating to your activity on our websites (including IP addresses)
                        via tracking technologies such as cookies, or we may collect information from you
                        in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics,
                        analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve
                        the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not
                        constitute personal information, the National Privacy Principles do not apply and
                        we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information,
                        or at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the
                        public via our services, such as in our classifieds, forums or blogs (Non-Confidential
                        Information). You acknowledge that we cannot control any third party collection
                        or use of your Non-Confidential Information. You agree that we may use and disclose
                        Non-Confidential Information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.
            </p>
            <h3>How we collect it<a name="2" id="2"></a></h3>
            <p>
                We may collect your personal information from a variety of sources, including from
                        you, advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business
                        partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may collect your personal information when you request or acquire a product or
                        service from us, register with us as a member, provide a product or service to us,
                        complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or event, contribute in
                        a fundraising event, participate in our services (including our radio programs,
                        blogs and forums) or when you communicate with us by e-mail, telephone or in writing
                        (for example if you contact customer service to make a complaint or provide feedback).
            </p>
            <p>
                If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than
                        yourself, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide such information
                        for the purpose specified.
            </p>
            <h3>Why we collect it<a name="3" id="3"></a></h3>

                        to provide you with our products or services. For example, if you do not register
                        as a member of a website, you will not be able to access features or services that
                        are reserved for members only.

            </p>
            <p>

                            that disclosure is necessary to the Police, any relevant authority or enforcement
                            body, or your Internet Service Provider or network administrator; </li>
                <li>as part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all or part of our business; and/or
