            <h4>1. Publication of Advertising</h4>
            <p>
                1.1 Subject to these Terms, TheMusic Classies  will use its reasonable endeavours to publish
                advertising submitted by Customers (‘Advertising’) in the format submitted by the
                Customer and in accordance with the placement instructions of the Customer. 1.2
                TheMusic Classies  may, in its discretion and without further cost to the Customer, re-publish
                Advertising in TheMusic Classies  publications.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Right to Refuse or Withdraw Advertising
            </h4>
            <p>
                2.1 Neither these Terms nor any written or verbal quotation by TheMusic Classies  represent an
                offer to publish Advertising. A binding contract in relation to a request for Advertising
                will only be formed between TheMusic Classies  and a Customer when TheMusic Classies  accepts Advertising
                in writing or generates a GST compliant invoice for that Advertising. 2.2 Even if
                a contract has been formed in accordance with the above clause, TheMusic Classies  reserves the
                right to refuse or withdraw from publication any Advertising at any time without
                giving reasons (even if the Advertising has previously been published by TheMusic Classies ).
            </p>
            <h4>3. Right to Vary Format and Placement
            </h4>
            <p>
                3.1 TheMusic Classies  reserves the right; (a) to vary the placement of Advertising. (b) to change
                the format of print Advertising (including but not limited to changing a format
                from colour to black and white). 3.2 TheMusic Classies  will endeavour to notify the Customer
                of any such changes. However, except in accordance with clause 11. TheMusic Classies  will not
                be liable for any costs, expenses, losses or damages suffered or incurred by a Customer
                arising from TheMusic Classies ’s failure to publish Advertising in accordance with a Customer’s
                request.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Submission of Advertising
            </h4>
            <p>
                4.1 By submitting Advertising for publication, the Customer warrants to TheMusic Classies  that
                the Advertising does not breach or infringe: (a) the Trade Practices Act (Cth),
                Fair Trading Acts (State) and equivalent legislation; (b) State and Commonwealth
                anti-discrimination legislation; (c) any copyright, trade mark or obligation of
                confidentiality; (d) any law of defamation or obscenity; (e) any law of contempt
                of any court, tribunal or royal commission; and (f) any other law (including but
                not limited to any common law, statute, delegated legislation, rule and ordinance
                of the Commonwealth or any State or Territory). 4.2 The Customer must not submit
                Advertising for publication that contains contact details for the Customer if those
                contact details do not include the full name and street address of the Customer.
                Post office box and email addresses alone are insufficient. 4.3 If, in TheMusic Classies ’s opinion,
                a Customer submits Advertising that looks like editorial material, TheMusic Classies  may publish
                the Advertising under the heading ‘Advertising’ and with a border distinguishing
                it from nearby editorial. 4.4 The Customer must collect Advertising material submitted
                to TheMusic Classies  immediately after publication. TheMusic Classies  will endeavour to take reasonable
                care of Advertising material in its custody and control, but will not be responsible
                for any loss or damage to Advertising material (even if caused by TheMusic Classies ’s negligence).
            </p>
            <h4>5. Classified Advertising
            </h4>
            <p>
                5.1 TheMusic Classies  will publish classified Advertising under the classification heading that
                it reasonably believes is most appropriate. Classified Advertising headings are
                for the convenience of readers and are determined at the discretion of TheMusic Classies . 5.2
                TheMusic Classies  will publish classified display Advertising sorted by alphabetical caption
                and, where space permits, with related line Advertising.
            </p>
            <h4>6. Errors</h4>
            <p>
                6.1 The Customer must promptly: (a) check proofs of Advertising provided to the
                Customer by TheMusic Classies ; and (b) notify TheMusic Classies  of any errors in the proofs or any published
                Advertising. 6.2 TheMusic Classies  does not accept responsibility for any errors in print Advertising
                placed over the telephone. 6.3 If a Customer wishes to make a claim on TheMusic Classies  for
                credit, re-publication or any other remedy in respect of Advertising, the Customer
                must send the claim in writing to TheMusic Classies  no later than 25 days after the date of
                the tax invoice or date of publication of the Advertising (whichever is earlier).
                6.4 TheMusic Classies  will only investigate complaints during normal office hours (9am to 5pm,
                Monday to Friday excluding public holidays).
            </p>
            <h4>7. Advertising Rates and Taxes
            </h4>
            <p>
                7.1 The Customer must pay for Advertising in accordance with the rates in TheMusic Classies ’s
                Advertising Ratecard (and, unless otherwise agreed, at the casual or basic rate).
                The rates in the Ratecard: (a) may be varied at any time by TheMusic Classies  without notice;
                and (b) are exclusive of taxes, duties or GST (‘Taxes’), unless the Ratecard specifies
                that GST or other Taxes are included. 7.2 The Customer must pay an additional amount
                equal to any Taxes payable by TheMusic Classies  in respect of Advertising. TheMusic Classies  will provide
                Customers with a tax invoice or adjustment note (as applicable) in a compliant form
                for GST purposes. 7.3 The Customer’s eligibility for discounts and rebates will
                be based on the Customer’s GSTexclusive Advertising spend, which will be subsequently
                adjusted for applicable GST.
            </p>
            <h4>8. Credit
            </h4>

                8.2 The Customer must ensure that its Customer account number is available only

                account number.
            </p>
            <h4>9. Payment

                is greater; (b) the full price for Advertising notwithstanding: (i) the fact that
                TheMusic Classies  has exercised its right to vary the format or placement of the Advertising;
                and (ii) any error or omission in the Advertising (unless the error or omission
                was the fault of TheMusic Classies ).
            </p>
            <h4>10. Failure to Pay and other Breach
            </h4>
            <p>
                10.1 If a Customer fails to pay for Advertising in accordance with clause 10 or
                if a Customer suffers an Insolvency Event as defined in clause 11.2, TheMusic Classies  may (in
                its discretion and without limitation): (a) cancel any provision of credit to the
                Customer; (b) require cash pre-payment for further Advertising; (c) charge interest
                on all overdue amounts at the rate 2% above the ANZ Bank Overdraft Base Rate; (d)
                take proceedings against the Customer for any outstanding amounts; (e) recover from
                the Customer all costs relating to any action taken by TheMusic Classies  to recover amounts

                and legal costs on a full indemnity basis; (f) cease publication of any further
                Advertising on behalf of the Customer and terminate any agreement in relation to

                and the Customer: (i) cannot pay its debts as and when they fall due; (ii) enters

                liquidator or administrator is appointed to any of its property or assets; or (v)
                any petition is presented for the winding up of the Customer. 10.3 TheMusic Classies  reserves
                the right to withhold any discounts or rebates if the Customer fails to comply with
                its payment obligations. 10.4 A written statement of debt duly signed by an authorised
                employee of TheMusic Classies  shall be prima facie evidence and proof of the amount owed by
                the Customer to TheMusic Classies .

                11.3 TheMusic Classies  limits its liability: (a) for breach of any Non-Excludable Condition
                (to the extent that liability for such breach can by law be limited); and (b) for

                option) resupply of the Advertising services affected by the breach, or payment
                of the cost of re-supply. 11.4 Subject to clauses 11.2 and 11.3, TheMusic Classies  excludes
                all other liability to the Customer for any costs, expenses, losses and damages
                suffered or incurred by the Customer in connection with these Terms and any Advertising
                published by TheMusic Classies , whether that liability arises in contract, tort (including by

                and its officers, employees, contractors and agents (the ‘Indemnified’) against
                any costs, expenses, losses, damages and liability suffered or incurred by the Indemnified
                arising from the Customer’s breach of these Terms and any negligent or unlawful
                act or omission of the Customer in connection with the Advertising.
